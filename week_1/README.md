## Welcome to Week 1 of the Robotics:
#### Aerial Robotics course!
We hope you are having a good time and learning a lot already! </br>
In this week, we will first focus on the **kinematics of quadrotors**. Then, you will learn how to derive the dynamic equations of motion for quadrotors. To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed.</br>
In this week, you will also complete your first programming assignment on **1-D quadrotor control**. </br>
If you have not done so already, please download, install, and learn about Matlab before starting the assignment.

If you are having any difficulties with the course, please reach out to any of us, we will surely help you out.</br>

***See you in Week 2!***
