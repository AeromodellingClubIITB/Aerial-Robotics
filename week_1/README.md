## Welcome to Week 1 of the Robotics:
#### Aerial Robotics course!
We hope you are having a good time and learning a lot already! </br>
In this week, we will first focus on the **kinematics of quadrotors**. Then, you will learn how to derive the dynamic equations of motion for quadrotors. To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed.</br>
In this week, you will also complete your first programming assignment on **1-D quadrotor control**. </br>
If you have not done so already, please download, install, and learn about Matlab before starting the assignment.

#### Assignment 
The [Assignment 1](http://github.com/AeromodellingClubIITB/Aerial-Robotics/blob/main/week_1/Assignment%201.pdf) will be used for evaluation of the course, hence you are expected to complete that within the week.</br>
If you get stuck in any of the questions, feel free to post them in the whatsapp group. As this is first graded assignment try your best to solve. You will learn a lot from this.</br>
If you are having any difficulties with the course, please reach out to any of us, we will surely help you out.</br>
