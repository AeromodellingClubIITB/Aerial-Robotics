## Welcome to Week 2 of the Robotics:
#### Aerial Robotics course!
We hope you are enjoying the course and learning a lot !! </br>
In this week, we will focus on the **Kinematics and Dynamics of Quadrotor**.Then, you will learn how to derive the Equation of Motion for quadrotors. We will also learn implementation of **2-D QuadCopter Controller** .To build a better understanding on these notions, some essential mathematical tools are discussed.</br>



## Assignment 
The [Assignment](http://github.com/AeromodellingClubIITB/Aerial-Robotics/blob/main/week_1/Assignment%201.pdf) for this week is also added in the script at end.</br>
If you get stuck in any of the questions, feel free to post them in the whatsapp group. We encourage you to start working on the assignment soon.Submission deadline will be updated here as well as on whatsapp group.</br>
