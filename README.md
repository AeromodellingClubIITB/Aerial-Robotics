# Greetings from the Aeromodelling Club!
#### Hello Aviation enthusiasts! </br>
Aeromodelling Club is delighed to bring an interesting MATLAB course on **Aerial Robotics**.</br>
We hope you're excited to dive deep into the realm of multirotors. 

In this course we are going to learn-</br>
* How can we create micro aerial vehicles that are able to operate **autonomously** in cluttered indoor and outdoor environments? </br>
* You will gain an **[Introduction to the mechanics of flight](https://github.com/AeromodellingClubIITB/Aerial-Robotics/blob/main/week_0/Inroduction%20to%20UAV's%20and%20MATLAB%20Setup.mlx)** and the **design of quadrotor flying robots** and will be able to develop dynamic models, derive controllers, and synthesize planners for operating in three dimensional environments. 
* You will be exposed to the challenges of using noisy sensors for **localization and maneuvering** in complex, three-dimensional environments.
* Finally, you will gain insights through seeing real world examples of the possible applications and challenges for the rapidly-growing drone industry.</br>

We will use **MATLAB** in this course.Tutorials for getting you familiarised with the platforms will be provided.</br>
To get better understanding of the course and better learning per week Assignments will be provided.

If you have questions/Queries about course content or any doubt, feel free to ask in the whatsapp group you are added, we will surely help you out.</br>

                               Keep up the enthusiasm and I hope you enjoy the course!
