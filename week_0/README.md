## Welcome to Week 0!
In this week, you will be introduced to the exciting field of **Unmanned Aerial Robotics (UAVs)** and **quadrotors** in particular. You will learn about their basic mechanics and control strategies and realize how careful component selection and design affect the vehicles' performance. <br />

This week also provides you with instructions on how to **download and install MALAB**. This software will be used throughout this course in exercises and assignments, so it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Matlab soon. Tutorials to help you get started are also provided in this week.

***Good luck as you get started, and I hope you enjoy the course!***
