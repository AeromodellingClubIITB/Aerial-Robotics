## Welcome to Week 0!
In this week, you will be introduced to the exciting field of **Unmanned Aerial Robotics (UAVs)** and **quadrotors** in particular. You will learn about their basic mechanics and control strategies and realize how careful component selection and design affect the vehicles' performance. <br />

This week also provides you with instructions on how to **download and install MATLAB**. This software will be used throughout this course in exercises and assignments, so it is strongly recommended to familiarize yourself with Matlab soon. Tutorials to help you get started are also provided in this week.

Hope you all are done with the installation part and started your hands on MATLAB tutorials. <br />
Also you have tried the assignment given based on week0 material to get you familiarized with the software and better understanding.
