## Welcome to Week 3 of the Robotics:
#### Aerial Robotics course!
Welcome to Week 3!</br>
We have developed planar and **three-dimensional dynamic models** of the quadrotor. This week, you will learn more about how to develop **linear controllers** for these models. With this knowledge, focuses on controlling the quadrotor in three dimensions. This week ends with a discussion on trajectory planning for quadrotors in three dimensional.

In this last week of the course, some more advanced material on how to enable quadrotors to perform more **agile maneuvers** and to operate **autonomously** in teams is also added as supplymentary material if you want to explore more,you can continue.</br>

## Assignment 
[Assignment](https://github.com/AeromodellingClubIITB/Aerial-Robotics/tree/main/Week_3/Assignment) for this week is also uploaded ,firstly understand the content completely then move on to the assignment.</br>
Note that this last programming assignment on quadrotor control in three dimensions uses material from the previous weeks. It is strongly recommended to start the assignment as soon as possible.</br>
You will be updated in WA group when is the assignment deadline for this week.
